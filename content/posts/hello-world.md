Writing a blog is not something I have done before, but I will try to keep up with it this year, as a new years resolution. The content will likely be focused on tech but occasionally on other stuff as well.

The blog is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on GitHub spaces. A combination which makes it easy to own your content in case of self-hosting or migrating content elsewhere.
